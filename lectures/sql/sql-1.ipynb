    "So far, we've worked exclusively with data that could conveniently fit in memory. Generally speaking, data sets of under 20 megabytes or so can be loaded easily on most modern laptops, although subsequent analysis activities may be slow. Larger data sets can be noticeably slow to even load into memory. For example, you may  have noticed that so far, I've been using a small subset of the NOAA-GHCN data corresponding to the decade 2011-2020. There's much  more data, and I have the complete data set in a file (also uploaded as a `.zip` archive on CCLE) in the same directory as these lecture notes on my personal machine. The complete set of data is not too big to fit in memory, but it's large enough that it's noticeably slow to even load into memory. Let's take a look. "
