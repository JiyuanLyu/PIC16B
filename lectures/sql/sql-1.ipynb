    "So far, we've worked exclusively with data that could conveniently fit in memory. Generally speaking, data sets of under 20 megabytes or so can be loaded easily on most modern laptops, although subsequent analysis activities may be slow. Larger data sets can be noticeably slow to even load into memory. For example, you may  have noticed that so far, I've been using a small subset of the NOAA-GHCN data corresponding to the decade 2011-2020. There's much  more data, and I have the complete data set in a file (also uploaded as a `.zip` archive on CCLE) in the same directory as these lecture notes on my personal machine. The complete set of data is not too big to fit in memory, but it's large enough that it's noticeably slow to even load into memory. Let's take a look. "

    "1. Reading large data sets into memory can be surprisingly slow, and in some cases completely impractical. \n",
    "2. Databases offer a convenient way to perform selective *queries* on our data, allowing us to retrieve only the data that we want at any given time. \n",
    "3. The `sqlite3` package enables us to work with databases using Python commands, and the `pandas` package makes it easy to read the results of database queries as data frames. "
