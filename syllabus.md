1. **I want you to succeed.** The purpose of this course is for you to build a set of skills that can support you in your studies, hobbies, and careers. You (yes, **you**) are able to learn some cool stuff and get a good grade in this course. 
2. **None of us signed up for this.** We are all doing the best we can during a time of catastrophe and intense uncertainty. My main aims in designing this course are to (a) offer you flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances and (b) encourage you to support and be supported by your classmates. Python programming is fun, and I hope that this course can be a positive part of your life during these difficult times. 
3. **Your wellbeing comes first.** If at any time during this course, you require accommodations in order to ensure your own wellbeing or that of a loved one, please reach out to me. We will make it happen. 
4. **We've got your back.** I'll be available to you through multiple channels. Additionally, you have an amazing support team -- your TA and peers will all be helping you in your learning journey.  

Ok, now on to the usual syllabus stuff. 

<div class="fancy-h1"> Course Overview </div>

Python offers a wide array of tools for solving problems in modern computational science. In this course, we will apply some of the most important such tools, with a focus on applications in applied mathematics, data analysis, and machine learning. Along the way, we will use industry-standard workflows for versioning, revising, and sharing code. We will also practice communicating our code to broader audiences. This offering of PIC16B places special emphasis on project-based learning and technical communication.


## Primary Learning Goals

1. **Core Programming**: You will create complex Python programs for solving a range of problems in computational science. 
2. **Code Analysis**: You will collaboratively analyze and revise Python programs to improve clarity, robustness, and performance. 
3. **Code Communication**: You will analyze and explain Python programs to nontechnical audiences in clear and engaging prose. 
5. **Self-Teaching**: You will grow as an effective autodidact ([self-teacher](https://rtalbert.org/in-defense-of-teaching-yourself-the-material/)) of programming tools and techniques. 
4. **Online Presence**: You will maintain a public portfolio of coding projects using industry-standard tools for code management. 

## Prerequisites

The only formal prerequisite for this course is PIC16A. In practice, I am expecting you to have **working knowledge** of the tools from PIC16A, including object-oriented programming, basic `numpy` and `pandas`, and basic machine learing using `scikit-learn`. Feeling a little rusty? That's ok! You might want to consult some [lecture notes and videos](https://philchodrow.github.io/PIC16B/schedule/) from PIC16A.

### About Math

There is no mathematics prerequisite for PIC16B. That said, PIC16B handles a variety of technical topics, such as linear algebra, optimization, and machine learning, for which math up to MATH 33A or 115A is helpful. 

If you haven't taken these courses, then that's ok! You'll have a slightly rougher ride in a couple weeks of the course, but I promise that we will get through together just fine. 

## Official course description 

*Lecture, three hours; discussion, one hour. Requisites: Course PIC16A or equivalent. In depth application of the Python programming language to problems arising in a variety of areas of current interest such as machine learning, computer vision, statistical analysis, numerical analysis, and data acquisition.

### Grading Philosophy

I do not grade on the basis of ranks or other distributional information. Your final letter grade in this course is a reflection of your own effort, learning, and teamwork. If every student fully meets my expectations along these axes, then I will not hesitate to give every student an A. In particular, there is no competition for grades in my class.  

> We are all on the same team. 

Please do not hesitate to help each other out in ways that support your shared learning. When reasonably possible, **I will reward exceptional collaboration.** 

### How to Earn an A

I fully expect that most or even all students will earn As in this course. To get an A in the course, you will need to: 

- Manage multiple, sometimes overlapping deadlines. 
- Make long-term plans with your group members. 
- Put substantial effort into helping your peers improve their own projects. 
- Persevere in solving problems whose solution may not be obvious. 
- Seek help when you need it. 

I believe that all students here can show these skills. If you do, you'll finish the quarter with an A in the course and some exceptionally impressive achievements in computational science with Python. 

### Homework

Homework assignments are one of the primary ways on which you will receive feedback on your code and technical writing in this course. Each assignment will ask you to solve one or more problems **and write about them** on your blog (yes, you will have a blog, [demo here](https://pic16b.github.io/)). Your writing should be expository in format, so that someone who had not studied this problem before would be able to learn how to solve it from your writing. As usual, your write-up should include code with documentation, printed outputs, and expository text. Early in the course, we will go over how to turn Jupyter notebooks into posts on your blog. 

There are just three homework assignments in this course. Each one will stretch over two weeks. In the first week, you'll create a draft of your blog post, which you will turn in as a Jupyter Notebook. In the second week, you will give feedback on the drafts of your classmates, receive feedback on your own draft, revise your approach, and turn it into a published blog post. 

The lowest homework grade will be dropped. 

### Participation

There are a few forms of required participation in PIC16A. The primary one is as a reviewer for your peers' drafts of their blog posts. In each homework assignment, you will be assigned a small group (rotating each time) of partners whose drafts you will review. **Your reviews will be graded** on thoughtfulness, helpfulness, and clarity, and counted under the Participation grade. 

### Project

The single largest component of your grade is the [project](https://philchodrow.github.io/PIC16B/schedule/). Over the course of the quarter, you will: 

1. Identify an interesting and relevant problem that can be solved using computational methods. 
2. Acquire data relevant to your problem. 
3. Design and implement a computational solution to your problem.  
4. Post periodic updates about your progress on your blog. 
5. Give feedback on your peer's projects, and revise your own projects in response to peer feedback. 
6. Host your project in a public repository as part of your code portfolio. 

**You are expected to work in a group of 2-3 students on the project**. If you would like to work in a larger group, or if you would like to work on your project solo, you must first request approval from me. 

There are graded milestones throughout the quarter in which you will give updates on the status of your project. In many Discussion sections, you will be expected to give a short presentation in which you update the class on the status of your project. Project proposals will also be graded. Toward the end of the course, there will be an exchange of peer feedback on the projects, in similar format to the homeworks. 

### Extra Credit

There are several ways to earn extra credit in PIC16B. 

#### Essay

At any time prior to the end of instruction (Friday, June 4th, 2021), you may submit an essay of between 900 and 1200 words (approximately 3-4 double-spaced pages) on a topic broadly related to the themes of algorithms, equity, and justice. Your essay should address a concrete problem; assess the current state of affairs; and suggest one or more paths forward. Examples of suitable topics related to algorithms and justice include but are no means limited to bias in facial recognition; the impact of automation on social services for the poor; and the role of technology in combatting climate change. Please note that questions of equity and justice are more specific than the general impact of social media or tech companies on society as a whole. Essays on such general topics are likely to receive only partial credit. 

Somewhat more generally, a successful essay will discuss:

- **Concrete benefits or harms**. Examples of concrete benefits or harms include changes to one's likelihood of being arrested, granted health services, approved for a loan, or granted reasonably-priced health insurance. 
- **Disparate impacts**. You should show that the system in question harms or benefits certain groups more than others. 

**A bad example**: arguing that social media is driving political polarization (this is a good topic, but not for this prompt). 

**A better example**: arguing that polarization on social media is leading to an increase in hate crimes toward specific marginalized groups. 

You are welcome to argue any angle on your topic, provided that you can offer sound sources and argumentation. For example, you may argue that bias in facial recognition is a major problem in need of solution, or you may argue that no substantial problem exists. You are welcome to ask me about your sources and proposed argument before you begin writing.   

This essay will be graded out of 3 points, and the result will be added as a percentage to your final average in the course. For instance, if your essay earns 2 points, 2% will be added to your final average. Because 3% is quite a lot of extra credit, I will tend to hold these essays to very high standards. Exceptional effort is required if you want all three points.


Your essay should satisfy the following criteria. 

- **Sources**: The essay should cite and elaborate on at least five news articles, blog posts, or other sources. Opinion articles do not count. You should use a consistent citation convention. If you're not sure which one to use, [APA](https://www.library.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/apa_2010.pdf) and [MLA](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_formatting_and_style_guide.html) are both good choices. Up to one source may be a documentary film, while at least two must be written. 
- **Argument**: The essay should have a *thesis statement*, which is supported by the discussion of the sources. Several examples of successful thesis statements: 
    - *Taken together, these articles suggest that algorithmic surveillance of marginalized groups is only increasing with time.*
    - *Although studies have revealed significant biases in Google Search, more recent work suggests that these biases may be less important in practice than once believed.*
    - *While many proposals exist for how algorithms and computation can be used to combat climate change, these proposals often overlook the role of human interpretation in implementing computer-generating guidance.*
- **Grammar and Writing**: Your essay should be written in engaging and grammatical English, with complete sentences and careful punctuation. 

The [Undergraduate Writing Center](https://wp.ucla.edu/wc/) is an excellent resource for helping you craft high-quality essays. 

**Suggestions for Sources**

You are free to use any sources to which you have access. If you are having trouble getting started, the following may be useful starting places. 

- The [Algorithmic Justice League](https://www.ajl.org/about) maintains a [library](https://www.ajl.org/library/home) of articles and announcements that may help you find suitable material. Especially relevant for topics at the intersection of algorithms and racial justice. 
- A [list of articles](https://blog.getpocket.com/2020/06/the-bias-embedded-in-algorithms/) on bias in algorithms. This list is curated by Safiya Umoja Noble, author of [Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism](https://nyupress.org/9781479837243/algorithms-of-oppression/) and faculty here at UCLA. 
- Cathy O'Neil, author of the excellent book *Weapons of Math Destruction*, has a [blog](https://mathbabe.org/page/2/). Many of her posts are opinion pieces (and therefore unsuitable for citation), but she always provides links to primary material, which you can use. 

#### Campuswire

There is a Campuswire discussion forum associated with this course, where you can post both questions and answers about the course content.  If you post a particularly insightful question or answer, I will (at my discretion) award you 0.25% of extra credit toward your final grade. You can earn extra credit this way up to four times, for a total of 1% extra credit.

#### Course Feedback

There will be several surveys throughout the quarter which allow you to give me feedback on the course. Completing these feedback surveys is worth 0.25% extra credit each.



<div class="fancy-h1">Learning on Zoom</div>

## Cameras

  We're all humans. Many of us are feeling isolated or lonely in the time of COVID. As your instructor, it brightens my day to see your faces. So, when attending lecture, **please consider turning your camera on**, if your situation allows. There is no judgement and no penalty for attending lecture in bed, in you pajamas, wrapped in a blanket, etc. Conversely, there is no penalty for leaving your camera off, and I will not inquire. 

  When working in small groups, it is especially important to engage with your group members as peers, mentors, and individuals. In this setting, I **strongly encourage** you to turn on your camera. When rotating through groups, I or the TA may ask you whether there is a reason why your camera is off. 

## Microphones

  In large meetings, it's good etiquette to mute your microphone when you are not actively talking. Feel free to unmute yourself when you have a question for me or for the TA. When working in small groups, leave your microphone on unless there's a lot of ambient noise. 

<div class="fancy-h1"> Advice,  Letters, and Research</div>

## Advice

I am always happy to talk with you about your future plans, including courses, internships, REUs, and graduate school applications. Because I am a creature of the academy, I am less knowledgeable about industry jobs, although you are welcome to ask about those too. If you'd like to set up a chat, please use the Calendly link provided under Site Info on CCLE. 

## Letters of Recommendation

You are also always welcome to ask me to write a recommendation letter supporting your applications for grad school, research internships, and jobs. I will usually agree to do so, although see the exceptions below. I will also tell you if I feel that the letter I would write would not be strong. Please keep in mind that I can write stronger letters for students whom I see more frequently, such as in lecture or OH. If you'd like a letter, talking to me in these contexts, or scheduling another meeting time, is highly recommended.  

### To Request a Letter

Send me an email! Your email should clearly indicate  when you need the letter, what it is for, why the opportunity interests you, and why I am the right person to write in support of your application. Please include clear instructions for submitting the letter once it's written. If you will need me to submit my letter to multiple programs, please let me know roughly how many you expect to need. If possible, please include some sort of resume/CV --- it doesn't have to be official --- detailing your past experiences relevant to the application. **Please give me at least one month of advance notice** when possible. 

### When I Won't Write a Letter

As a matter of moral principle, I will not write letters of recommendation for programs or jobs involving any of the following:

- Policing (including but not limited to predictive policing, development of algorithms that predict recidivism, etc.);
- Military applications (such as internships at the Department of Defense or any of its international counterparts);
- Weapons manufacturing, broadly construed;
- Intelligence gathering (such as internships at the NSA, FBI, or any international counterpart).

I am very happy to discuss this policy with any student who has questions. Conversations about when and how mathematics, data science, and programming should be used are lacking in our community. If you'd like to engage me in such a conversation, that would be great! However, this policy is non-negotiable. Therefore, if I refuse to write you a letter on these grounds, please know that it doesn't reflect on your ability to succeed in PIC16B, your career potential, your worth as a person, or whether I like you. 

The [Just Mathematics Collective](https://www.justmathematicscollective.net/) has compiled a list of resources for students on making ethical career decisions, which is available [here](https://justmathematicscollective.net/career_resources.html). The text of this section is lightly modified from their [suggested text](https://www.justmathematicscollective.net/letter_writing.html) on letter-writing. 

## Research

I have some limited capacity to accept undergraduates to perform research with me. [My research](https://www.philchodrow.com/research/) focuses broadly on *network science*, the study of interconnected systems in nature and human society. Some things I'm interested in include applications of random graph theory, social network analysis, nonlinear dynamics on networks, and machine learning.  

If you would like to work with me on these topics, then it is usually necessary to take [Math 168, Introduction to Networks](https://www.registrar.ucla.edu/Academics/Course-Descriptions/Course-Details?qry=introduction%20to%20networks&funsel=1). You are also welcome to propose a project topic to me. If it is relevant to my interests but does not require background in network science, then taking Math 168 may not be necessary in order for us to work together.

I'd like to emphasize that my ability to take students is indeed *limited*. If I decline to work with you, that is again not a reflection on your ability to succeed in PIC16B, your potential as a researcher, your worth as a person, or whether I like you. 

<div class="fancy-h1"> Self-Teaching </div>

## Why Self-Teaching? 

One of the primary learning goals of this course is to build your ability to learn independently. I want you to teach yourself new programming ideas and tools, now and in the future. The reason is not because I don't want to teach you myself -- I do!. Rather, the reason is that what I know is limited, and what I can share in a quarter is even more limited. 

> If you stick to what you can learn from me directly, you will hold yourself back. 

Throughout the course, I will ask you to practice [self-teaching](https://rtalbert.org/in-defense-of-teaching-yourself-the-material/) -- taking charge of your own learning journey, to grow beyond what I can offer you directly. 

> Corollary: I want and expect that, by the end of this course, you will know more about certain Python topics than I do! 

What does this look like in practice? 

### Finding The Tools

In this course, much more than in PIC16A, I will ask you to perform a task for which we have not discussed all the tools in class. It will be your responsibility to help each other and find the right ones for the job. 

### Asking for Help

You can still ask for help, from me, the TA, and each other! Now that you're an advanced programming student working on self-teaching, there are a few things that you should try first:  

If you're debugging: 

1. Carefully **read your error message**, if there is one. 
2. **Google your error message** and see whether others have encountered a similar issue (trust me -- they have). 
3. **Simplify**: start removing parts of your code until you are able to construct a [minimal working example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) (MWE) of your issue. 
4. Now that you have checked around a bit and created a MWE, it's the right time to post a public question on Campuswire. Show your MWE code, the output of your MWE, and carefully describe what you've already done in the previous steps. 
5. Generally, if you've completed the above steps and haven't received an answer on Campuswire within 48 hours, I'll then make my best attempt to address your question directly.

Corollary: you are more likely to get help from others and from me if you *start early*. 

### "How do I do X"

1. Try to describe X fairly specifically, and Google it. Adding the names of packages can be helpful. 
  - **Example**: You want to encode a qualitative column of a Pandas data frame with an integer label. A good search for this is "pandas convert qualitative column," for which the [top result](https://pbpython.com/categorical-encoding.html) (in my browser) is a helpful guide to precisely this kind of task. 
2. If you know how to achieve a task that is similar to X, check the documentation of the associated tools to see whether there might be keyword arguments or methods that might help you achieve X. 
3. If you've done the above, now is a good time to post on Campuswire. Describe what you've already tried, including any relevant resources you may have found. 
4. Generally, if you've completed the above steps and haven't received an answer on Campuswire within 48 hours, I'll then make my beset attempt to address your question.

You can always ask me questions in OH. Be ready for me to ask you which of the above steps you've completed. If you haven't done many of them, then we may walk through some of the steps together. 

## Extensions and Accommodations

PIC16B has a fair number of long-term deadlines, including your project and multi-week homeworks. I expect you to manage your schedule accordingly, and to plan ahead. 

I will drop your lowest homework grade (i.e. you can skip a HW), and I will also drop some number of participation and project milestone grades TBD. 

> If there's a week or two when you just can't with this class, don't worry about it. 

### Extensions

Generally speaking, I almost never grant extensions after a deadline has past, and very rarely when the deadline is close. The primary exceptions are acute emergencies, especially health emergencies. I'll usually just invite you to use a drop instead.  

### Long-Term Challenges

You may encounter non-emergency conditions that make it difficult to complete your assignments by the stated deadline. 
In this age of disease, isolation, and political unrest, that is very normal! 
If you are struggling with your physical or mental health, please **approach me early** and we will have a conversation. 
The earlier we can talk,  the more I will be able to do for you.
