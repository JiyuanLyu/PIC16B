**Welcome to PIC16B!** I'm Phil Chodrow, your instructor, and I'm grateful that you're here. Before we dive into the details, I want to lay out some guiding principles for this course: 

<figure style="float:right">
  <img alt="Three stylized hands, appearing to made out of circuitry, reach toward each other. The hands are bright blue, green, and pink." src = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.eremedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/13112109/diversity-700x439.jpg" width="300" height="200"/> 
</figure>

1. **I want you to succeed.** The purpose of this course is for you to build a set of skills that can support you in your studies, hobbies, and careers. You (yes, **you**) are able to learn some cool stuff and get a good grade in this course. 
2. **It's still a challenging time.** I'm thrilled to be seeing you in person, and I hope that you're glad to be here. Still, you might feel challenged by the transition back to in-person instruction -- and that's ok! Maybe you need some time to re-acclimate to in-person socializing. Maybe you, your friends, or your loved ones are still affected by the pandemic in some way. So, while I hope we can celebrate our time together, I also hope we can all recognize that it may not be a totally smooth ride. If you're struggling with the transition back to in-person instruction, remember that you have support from your instructors, your classmates, and various student resources to help you navigate. 
3. **Your wellbeing comes first.** If at any time during this course, you require accommodations in order to ensure your own wellbeing or that of a loved one, please reach out to me. We will make it happen. 
4. **We've got your back.** I'll be available to you through multiple channels. Additionally, you have an amazing support team -- your TA and peers will all be helping you in your learning journey.  

Ok, now on to the usual syllabus stuff. 

<div class="fancy-h1"> Course Overview </div>

Python offers a wide array of tools for solving problems in modern computational science. In this course, we will apply some of the most important such tools, with a focus on applications in applied mathematics, data analysis, and machine learning. Along the way, we will use industry-standard workflows for versioning, revising, and sharing code. We will also practice communicating our code to broader audiences. This offering of PIC16B places special emphasis on project-based learning and technical communication.


## Primary Learning Goals

1. **Core Programming**: You will create complex Python programs for solving a range of problems in computational science. 
2. **Code Analysis**: You will collaboratively analyze and revise Python programs to improve clarity, robustness, and performance. 
3. **Code Communication**: You will analyze and explain Python programs to nontechnical audiences in clear and engaging prose. 
5. **Self-Teaching**: You will grow as an effective autodidact ([*self-teacher*](https://rtalbert.org/in-defense-of-teaching-yourself-the-material/)) of programming tools and techniques. 
4. **Online Presence**: You will maintain a public portfolio of coding projects using industry-standard tools for code management. 

## Prerequisites

The only formal prerequisite for this course is PIC16A. In practice, I am expecting you to have **working knowledge** of the tools from PIC16A, including object-oriented programming, basic `numpy` and `pandas`, and basic machine learing using `scikit-learn`. Feeling a little rusty? That's ok! You might want to consult some [lecture notes and videos](https://philchodrow.github.io/PIC16A/schedule/) from PIC16A.

### About Math

There is no mathematics prerequisite for PIC16B. That said, PIC16B handles a variety of technical topics, such as linear algebra, optimization, and machine learning, for which math up to MATH 33A or 115A is helpful. 

If you haven't taken these courses, then that's ok! You'll have a slightly rougher ride in a couple weeks of the course, but I promise that we will get through together just fine. 

## Official course description 

*Lecture, three hours; discussion, one hour. Requisites: Course PIC16A or equivalent. In depth application of the Python programming language to problems arising in a variety of areas of current interest such as machine learning, computer vision, statistical analysis, numerical analysis, and data acquisition.

<div class="fancy-h1"> Assessment</div>

## Overall Grade

<dl>
  <dt>Blog Posts  &nbsp;</dt>
  <dd> 60 points</dd>
  
  <dt>Project &nbsp;</dt>
  <dd> 50 points</dd>
  <dt>Essay &nbsp;</dt>
  <dd> 5 points</dd>
  <dt>Total &nbsp;</dt>
  <dd><b>115 points</b></dd>
</dl>

I compute letter grades on the straight scale, out of 100 points. So, if you finish the quarter with 95 points, that's an A! You can finish the quarter with more than 100 points, although you don't really gain anything from that other than pride. 

I handle the A+ grade a little differently. To get an A+, you must: 

- Finish the course with at least 100 points. 
- Submit an exceptionally impressive course project. 

Now let's talk about how to earn points. 

## Specifications Grading

I'm going to say something now that will sound scary. **I promise it's ok though,** keep reading. Here goes: 

> There is no partial credit in PIC16B. 

On-time assignments can receive either full credit or no credit -- there's nothing in between. Late assignments can receive either half or no credit. 

When does an assignment get credit? For each assignment, I will give you a relatively detailed list of *specifications* ("specs"). These specs are the requirements for the assignment. If your submission fully meets all the specs by the required deadline, then your assignment gets full credit. This mode of grading is often called *standards-based*, *mastery*, or *specifications* grading. 

If you don't get credit on an assignment, all is not lost! On most assignments, **you'll have a second submission opportunity**. If you improve your assignment to meet all the specs, then you'll again get full credit. 

## Assignment States

Most on-time assignments can be in one of two states: 

<span style="color: green;"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> **Complete** <br> The assignment fully meets specs and has received full credit.

<span style="color: gold;"><i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-up"></i></span> **In Progress**<br> The assignment has been submitted by the deadline, demonstrates significant effort, and is mostly up to spec. If submitted up to spec by the second deadline, the assignment will receive full credit.

Assignments that I find particularly impressive may receive a "Complete Plus" <span style="color: green;"><i class="fas fa-plus-circle"></i></span>. This is just there to let you know that I think you're doing great work, and that you should be proud of yourself! There's no difference between <span style="color: green;"><i class="fas fa-plus-circle"></i></span> and <span style="color: green;"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> for grading purposes. 

#### Late Assignments

An assignment is considered **late** if it was submitted after but **within one week** of the stated deadline; if it does not display significant effort to meet all specs; or if it is entirely missing required components. Late assignments can be resubmitted, for **half credit**. 

<span style="color: green;"><i class="far fa-check-circle"></i></span> **Complete (Late)** <br> The assignment fully meets specs and has received half credit.

<span style="color: gold;"><i class="far fa-arrow-alt-circle-up"></i></span> **In Progress (Late)**<br>
The assignment was not submitted by the deadline; fails to meet multiple major specs; or is entirely missing required components. If submitted up to spec by the second deadline, the assignment will become <span style="color: green;"><i class="far fa-check-circle"></i></span> **Complete (Late)**. 

#### Assignments Without Resubmissions

A very small number of assignments in this course will not allow resubmissions. The most important examples of these are project presentations, of which there will be several throughout the quarter. These will be graded with relatively relaxed specifications. Presentations that show collaboration, effort, and progress will usually receive full credit. 

## Why Specifications Grading?

There are a number of reasons why I have chosen to adopt specifications grading in PIC16B. Here are a few: 

1. **Career preparation**. In your professional career, there won't be any such thing as a 94% grade. Projects either meet the required specifications or they don't. When they don't, there's often a chance to improve them so that they do. The lack of partial credit, combined with multiple assignment opportunities, is meant to prepare you for this kind of experience. 
2. **Control**. I've tried to give you more control over your grade in this course. You shouldn't really have to guess about what grade you're going to get on an assignment. Check the specs -- did you meet them fully? If so, you should expect full credit. If not, you should expect a clear explanation of what needs to be improved, and an opportunity to act on that to receive full credit.  
3. **Communication**. I want you to know *exactly* what I'm looking for in an assignment. Specs grading gives me a responsibility to articulate my expectations as clearly and operationally as possible. 

## Possible Modifications 

My implementation of specs grading in Fall '21 is *experimental*. There will likely be mistakes, and we will work through them together. I will do my best to make sure that you never suffer for mistakes that I make. In particular: 

> I will never modify the grading scheme in a way that reduces the total number of points or makes it significantly harder to earn points. 

<div class="fancy-h1">Assignments</div>


# Blog Posts

Blog posts play the role of homework assignments in PIC16B. Early in the course, you will create a blog like [this one](https://pic16b.github.io/). This blog will host the blog posts you write for your homework submissions. 

## Writing

Each blog post will have detailed specs. One of the specs common to all blog posts is **writing**. 

> **Specification**: Your blog post should be structured and written as a *tutorial* so that a PIC16A student could learn how to solve the problem by reading your post. 

Please note that the writing spec is not optional; posts cannot receive (any) credit unless they are written in tutorial format. 

The usual method for preparing blog posts is to solve the problem in a Jupyter notebook, and then convert that notebook into a post. We'll go over this process early in the course. 

There are six graded blog posts, each of which is worth 10 points. Note that you can skip one of them and still finish the course with 100 points. Think of this like a "drop" in a more traditional grading scheme. 

All blog posts can be resubmitted once, within one week of receiving a first assessment. 
We'll do our best to get you your first assessments quickly so as to minimize the amount of time you're waiting to find out whether you need to resubmit or not. 

## Examples

Erin works hard on Blog Post 3, and submits it ahead of the deadline on Friday. They meet almost all the specs, but they didn't completely solve the very last part of the problem. The following Tuesday, they receive their first assessment: <span style="color: gold;"><i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-up"></i></span> **In Progress**. This assessment reflects that they clearly put effort into the entire assignment and met the majority of specs. They also receive feedback on what revisions are necessary. They successfully incorporate these revisions, and turn in a revised version within a week of receiving their assessment (i.e. by the next Tuesday). Their revised blog post is fully up to spec, and their revised assessment is <span style="color: green;"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> **Complete**. They receive full credit (10 points) for the assignment.  

Zenith had a really rough week, and wasn't really able to put enough effort into Blog Post 3. By the time she turns it in on Friday, her assignment is below spec in several ways and is not written in a tutorial format. Because she didn't not put sufficient effort into her assignment by the deadline, the assessment she receives on Tuesday is <span style="color: gold;"><i class="far fa-arrow-alt-circle-up"></i></span> **In Progress (Late)**. She can now decide whether she wants to bring it up to spec in order to get a <span style="color: green;"><i class="far fa-check-circle"></i></span> **Complete (Late)** for half credit (5 points) or whether her time would be better spent focusing on the next assignment. 

# Project

One of the most important components of PIC16B is the project. Over the course of the quarter, you will: 

1. Identify an interesting and relevant problem that can be solved using computational methods. 
2. Acquire data relevant to your problem. 
3. Design and implement a computational solution to your problem.  
4. Give periodic progress updates to your classmates. 
5. Revise your project in response to feedback. 
6. Host your project in a public repository as part of your code portfolio. 

**You are expected to work in a group of 2-3 students on the project**. If you would like to work in a larger group, or if you would like to work on your project solo, you must first request approval from me. 

Your overall project grade contains a number of components. These include: 

1. A project pitch in Week 1. 
2. A project proposal (with your group) in Week 3. 
3. Project updates in Weeks 5 and 7. 
4. An initial project submission in Week 9. 
5. A project presentation in Week 10. 
6. Project resubmission during Finals week. 

Each of these individual components will have their own specs. The specs for each component will be [here]({{site.assignments}}), not all of them are posted quite yet. 

# Essay 

For up to five (5) points, you may submit an essay on a topic broadly related to themes of algorithms, equity, and justice. Here's the [essay prompt and specs]({{site.essay}}). 

# Advice: How to Earn an A

I fully expect that most or even all students will earn As in this course. To get an A in the course, you will need to: 

- Manage multiple, sometimes overlapping deadlines. 
- Make long-term plans with your group members. 
- Put substantial effort into helping your peers. 
- Persevere in solving problems whose solution may not be obvious. 
- Seek help when you need it. 

I believe that all students here can show these skills. If you do, you'll finish the quarter with an A in the course and some exceptionally impressive achievements in computational science with Python. 

<div class="fancy-h1"> Self-Teaching </div>

## Why Self-Teaching? 

One of the primary learning goals of this course is to build your ability to learn independently. I want you to teach yourself new programming ideas and tools, now and in the future. The reason is not because I don't want to teach you myself -- I do! Rather, the reason is that what I know is limited, and what I can share in a quarter is even more limited. 

> If you stick to what you can learn from me directly, you will hold yourself back. 

Throughout the course, I will ask you to practice [self-teaching](https://rtalbert.org/in-defense-of-teaching-yourself-the-material/) -- taking charge of your own learning journey, to grow beyond what I can offer you directly. 

> Corollary: I want and expect that, by the end of this course, you will know more about certain Python topics than I do! 

What does this look like in practice? 

### Finding The Tools

In this course, much more than in PIC16A, I will ask you to perform a task for which we have not discussed all the tools in class. It will be your responsibility to help each other and find the right ones for the job. 

### Asking for Help

You can still ask for help, from me, the TA, and each other! Now that you're an advanced programming student working on self-teaching, there are a few things that you should try first:  

If you're debugging: 

1. Carefully **read your error message**, if there is one. 
2. **Google your error message** and see whether others have encountered a similar issue (trust me -- they have). 
3. **Simplify**: start removing parts of your code until you are able to construct a [minimal working example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) (MWE) of your issue. 
4. Now that you have checked around a bit and created a MWE, it's the right time to post a public question on Campuswire. Show your MWE code, the output of your MWE, and carefully describe what you've already done in the previous steps. 
5. Generally, if you've completed the above steps and haven't received an answer on Campuswire within 48 hours, I'll then make my best attempt to address your question directly.

Corollary: you are more likely to get help from others and from me if you *start early*. 

### "How do I do X"

1. Try to describe X fairly specifically, and Google it. Adding the names of packages can be helpful. **Example**: You want to encode a qualitative column of a Pandas data frame with an integer label. A good search for this is "pandas convert qualitative column," for which the [top result](https://pbpython.com/categorical-encoding.html) (in my browser) is a helpful guide to precisely this kind of task. 
2. If you know how to achieve a task that is similar to X, check the documentation of the associated tools to see whether there might be keyword arguments or methods that might help you achieve X. 
3. If you've done the above, now is a good time to post on Campuswire. Describe what you've already tried, including any relevant resources you may have found. 
4. Generally, if you've completed the above steps and haven't received an answer on Campuswire within 48 hours, I'll then make my beset attempt to address your question.

You can always ask me questions in OH. Be ready for me to ask you which of the above steps you've completed. If you haven't done many of them, then we may walk through some of the steps together. 

<div class="fancy-h1">Extensions and Accommodations</div>

PIC16B has a fair number of long-term deadlines, including your project and multi-week homeworks. I expect you to manage your schedule accordingly, and to plan ahead. 

The primary form of accommodation in this course is the fact that there are more than 100 points worth of assignments. If, for example, you skip a homework assignment, you can still finish the course with 100 points and a solid A. Additionally, up-to-spec homework can be submitted up to one week late to receive a half-credit <span style="color: green;"><i class="far fa-check-circle"></i></span> **Complete (Late)**. 

Because of this, **I do not expect to grant extensions to individual students in this class.**

### Long-Term Challenges

You may encounter non-emergency conditions that make it difficult to complete your assignments by the stated deadline. 
In this age of disease, isolation, and political unrest, that is very normal! 
If you are struggling with your physical or mental health, please **approach me early** and we will have a conversation. 
The earlier we can talk,  the more I will be able to do for you. 


<div class="fancy-h1">Class Resources</div>

## Slack

This quarter, we'll be trying an experiment: official course communication will happen on Slack. There will be channels for announcements, as well as channels for questions and answers. This is my first time using Slack in a course, so please don't hesitate to give feedback along the way about how we can improve the experience. 

We'll still be using CCLE for submitting assignments and managing grades. 

<div class="fancy-h1"> Advice,  Letters, and Research</div>

## Advice

I am always happy to talk with you about your future plans, including courses, internships, REUs, and graduate school applications. Because I am a creature of the academy, I am less knowledgeable about industry jobs, although you are welcome to ask about those too. If you'd like to set up a chat, please use the Calendly link provided under Site Info on CCLE. 

## Letters of Recommendation

You are also always welcome to ask me to write a recommendation letter supporting your applications for grad school, research internships, and jobs. I will usually agree to do so, although see the exceptions below. I will also tell you if I feel that the letter I would write would not be strong. Please keep in mind that I can write stronger letters for students whom I see more frequently, such as in lecture or OH. If you'd like a letter, talking to me in these contexts, or scheduling another meeting time, is highly recommended.  

### To Request a Letter

Send me an email! Your email should clearly indicate  when you need the letter, what it is for, why the opportunity interests you, and why I am the right person to write in support of your application. Please include clear instructions for submitting the letter once it's written. If you will need me to submit my letter to multiple programs, please let me know roughly how many you expect to need. If possible, please include some sort of resume/CV --- it doesn't have to be official --- detailing your past experiences relevant to the application. **Please give me at least one month of advance notice** when possible. 

### When I Won't Write a Letter

As a matter of moral principle, I will not write letters of recommendation for programs or jobs involving any of the following:

- Policing (including but not limited to predictive policing, development of algorithms that predict recidivism, etc.);
- Military applications (such as internships at the Department of Defense or any of its international counterparts);
- Weapons manufacturing, broadly construed;
- Intelligence gathering (such as internships at the NSA, FBI, or any international counterpart).

I am very happy to discuss this policy with any student who has questions. Conversations about when and how mathematics, data science, and programming should be used are lacking in our community. If you'd like to engage me in such a conversation, that would be great! However, this policy is non-negotiable. Therefore, if I refuse to write you a letter on these grounds, please know that it doesn't reflect on your ability to succeed in PIC16B, your career potential, your worth as a person, or whether I like you. 

The [Just Mathematics Collective](https://www.justmathematicscollective.net/) has compiled a list of resources for students on making ethical career decisions, which is available [here](https://justmathematicscollective.net/career_resources.html). The text of this section is lightly modified from their [suggested text](https://www.justmathematicscollective.net/letter_writing.html) on letter-writing. 

## Research

I have some limited capacity to accept undergraduates to perform research with me. [My research](https://www.philchodrow.com/research/) focuses broadly on *network science*, the study of interconnected systems in nature and human society. Some things I'm interested in include applications of random graph theory, social network analysis, nonlinear dynamics on networks, and machine learning.  

If you would like to work with me on these topics, then it is usually necessary to take [Math 168, Introduction to Networks](https://www.registrar.ucla.edu/Academics/Course-Descriptions/Course-Details?qry=introduction%20to%20networks&funsel=1). You are also welcome to propose a project topic to me. If it is relevant to my interests but does not require background in network science, then taking Math 168 may not be necessary in order for us to work together.

I'd like to emphasize that my ability to take students is indeed *limited*. If I decline to work with you, that is again not a reflection on your ability to succeed in PIC16B, your potential as a researcher, your worth as a person, or whether I like you.
