4. **We've got your back.** I'll be available to you through multiple channels. Additionally, you have an amazing support team -- your TAs, LAs, and peers will all be helping you in your learning journey.  

Ok, now on to the usual syllabus stuff. 

<div class="fancy-h1"> Course Overview </div>



Python offers a wide array of tools for solving problems in modern computational science. In this course, we will apply some of the most important such tools, with a focus on applications in applied mathematics, data analysis, and machine learning. Along the way, we will use industry-standard workflows for versioning, revising, and sharing code. We will also practice communicating our code to broader audiences. This offering of PIC16B places special emphasis on project-based learning and technical communication.


## Primary Learning Goals

1. **Core Programming**: You will create complex Python programs for solving a range of problems in computational science. 
2. **Code Analysis**: You will collaboratively analyze and revise Python programs to improve clarity, robustness, and performance. 
3. **Code Communication**: You will analyze and explain Python programs to nontechnical audiences in clear and engaging prose. 
5. **Code Discovery**: You will navigate the Python ecosystem, identifying and deploying new tools suited to domain-specific problems. 
4. **Online Presence**: You will maintain a public portfolio of coding projects using industry-standard tools for code management.

### Homework

Homework assignments are one of the primary ways on which you will receive feedback on your code and technical writing in this course. Each assignment will ask you to solve one or more problems **and write about them** on your blog (yes, you will have a blog). Your writing should be expository in format, so that someone who had not studied this problem before would be able to learn how to solve it from your writing. As usual, your write-up should include code with documentation, printed outputs, and expository text. Early in the course, we will go over how to turn Jupyter notebooks into posts on your blog. 

There are just three homework assignments in this course. Each one will stretch over two weeks. In the first week, you'll create a draft of your blog post, which you will turn in as a Jupyter Notebook. In the second week, you will give feedback on the drafts of your classmates, receive feedback on your own draft, revise your approach, and turn it into a published blog post. 

### Participation

There are a few forms of required participation in PIC16A. The primary one is as a reviewer for your peers' drafts of their blog posts. In each homework assignment, you will be assigned a small group (rotating each time) of partners whose drafts you will review. **Your reviews will be graded** on thoughtfulness, helpfulness, and clarity, and counted under the Participation grade. 


### Midterm Exam

There will be a week-long "take-home" midterm exam. This exam will cover core topics related to the first half of the course. The format will be similar to the first stage of a homework assignment. I will pose you an extended problem with a list of requirements. You will be responsible for solving this problem and turning in the result as a Jupyter Notebook. 

Provided that you obtain a score of 70% or better on the midterm exam, you will be permitted to replace this component of your grade with your grade from the project, in case the latter is higher. 

### Project

The single largest component of your grade is the project. Over the course of the quarter, you will: 

1. Identify an interesting and relevant problem that can be solved using computational methods. 
2. Acquire data relevant to your problem. 
3. Design and implement a computational solution to your problem.  
4. Post periodic updates about your progress on your blog. 
5. Give feedback on your peer's projects, and revise your own projects in response to peer feedback. 
6. Host your project in a public repository as part of your code portfolio. 

**Working in groups of up to three students for your project is highly encouraged**. 

There are graded milestones throughout the quarter in which you will give updates on the status of your project. In many Discussion sections, you will be expected to give a short presentation in which you update the class on the status of your project. Project proposals will also be graded. Toward the end of the course, there will be an exchange of peer feedback on the projects, in similar format to the homeworks. 

 
### Extra Credit

There are several ways to earn extra credit in PIC16B. 

#### Essay

At any time prior to the end of instruction (Friday, June 4th, 2021), you may submit an essay of between 900 and 1200 words (approximately 3-4 double-spaced pages) on a topic broadly related to the themes of algorithms, equity, and justice. Your essay should address a concrete problem; assess the current state of affairs; and suggest one or more paths forward. Examples of suitable topics related to algorithms and justice include but are no means limited to bias in facial recognition; the impact of automation on social services for the poor; and the role of technology in combatting climate change. Please note that questions of equity and justice are more specific than the general impact of social media or tech companies on society as a whole. Essays on such general topics are likely to receive only partial credit. 

You are welcome to argue any angle on your topic, provided that you can offer sound sources and argumentation. For example, you may argue that bias in facial recognition is a major problem in need of solution, or you may argue that no substantial problem exists. You are welcome to ask me about your sources and proposed argument before you begin writing.   

This essay will be graded out of 3 points, and the result will be added as a percentage to your final average in the course. For instance, if your essay earns 2 points, 2% will be added to your final average. Because 3% is quite a lot of extra credit, I will tend to hold these essays to very high standards. Exceptional effort is required if you want all three points.


Your essay should satisfy the following criteria. 

- **Sources**: The essay should cite and elaborate on at least five news articles, blog posts, or other sources. Opinion articles do not count. You should use a consistent citation convention. If you're not sure which one to use, [APA](https://www.library.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/apa_2010.pdf) and [MLA](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_formatting_and_style_guide.html) are both good choices. Up to one source may be a documentary film, while at least two must be written. 
- **Argument**: The essay should have a *thesis statement*, which is supported by the discussion of the sources. Several examples of successful thesis statements: 
    - *Taken together, these articles suggest that algorithmic surveillance of marginalized groups is only increasing with time.*
    - *Although studies have revealed significant biases in Google Search, more recent work suggests that these biases may be less important in practice than once believed.*
    - *While many proposals exist for how algorithms and computation can be used to combat climate change, these proposals often overlook the role of human interpretation in implementing computer-generating guidance.*
- **Grammar and Writing**: Your essay should be written in engaging and grammatical English, with complete sentences and careful punctuation. 

The [Undergraduate Writing Center](https://wp.ucla.edu/wc/) is an excellent resource for helping you craft high-quality essays. 

**Suggestions for Sources**

You are free to use any sources to which you have access. If you are having trouble getting started, the following may be useful starting places. 

- The [Algorithmic Justice League](https://www.ajl.org/about) maintains a [library](https://www.ajl.org/library/home) of articles and announcements that may help you find suitable material. Especially relevant for topics at the intersection of algorithms and racial justice. 
- A [list of articles](https://blog.getpocket.com/2020/06/the-bias-embedded-in-algorithms/) on bias in algorithms. This list is curated by Safiya Umoja Noble, author of [Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism](https://nyupress.org/9781479837243/algorithms-of-oppression/) and faculty here at UCLA. 
- Cathy O'Neil, author of the excellent book *Weapons of Math Destruction*, has a [blog](https://mathbabe.org/page/2/). Many of her posts are opinion pieces (and therefore unsuitable for citation), but she always provides links to primary material, which you can use. 

#### Campuswire

There is a Campuswire discussion forum associated with this course, where you can post both questions and answers about the course content. If you post a particularly insightful question or answer, I will (at my discretion) award you 0.25% of extra credit toward your final grade. You can earn extra credit this way up to four times, for a total of 1% extra credit.

#### Course Feedback

There will be several surveys throughout the quarter which allow you to give me feedback on the course. Completing these feedback surveys is worth 0.25% extra credit, each.



<div class="fancy-h1">Learning on Zoom</div>

## Cameras

  We're all humans. Many of us are feeling isolated or lonely in the time of COVID. As your instructor, it brightens my day to see your faces. So, when attending lecture, **please consider turning your camera on**, if your situation admits. There is no judgement and no penalty for attending lecture in bed, in you pajamas, wrapped in a blanket, etc. Conversely, there is no penalty for leaving your camera off, and I will not inquire. 

  When working in small groups, it is especially important to engage with your group members as peers, mentors, and individuals. In this setting, I **strongly encourage** you to turn on your camera. When rotating through groups, I or the TA may ask you whether there is a reason why your camera is off. 

## Microphones

  In large meetings, it's good etiquette to mute your microphone when you are not actively talking. Feel free to unmute yourself when you have a question for me or for the TA. When working in small groups, leave your microphone on unless there's a lot of ambient noise.

    </div>
</div>

<br>

<div class="fancy-h1"> Collaboration and Academic Honesty</div>

I heartily encourage you to collaborate with your peers on homework and many in-class activities. You should ask questions, brainstorm ideas, and offer suggestions *at a conceptual level.* In general, **you should not share code with your peers** in any circumstances, as this deprives them of the opportunity to learn how to operationalize their ideas. 

The midterm is open-book and open-notes. You should not discuss any aspect of these evaluations with your peers, and doing so will constitute a violation of UCLA's [student code of conduct](https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Individual-Student-Code). 

<div class="fancy-h1"> Getting Help </div>

## Extensions Policy

These are challenging times. From disease to internet access to political unrest, there are many reasons why you might struggle to complete your work on time. In awareness of this situation, PIC16A includes an large number of drops for homework, participation assignments, and quizzes -- around two weeks worth of drops in each category.  Additionally, there are several opportunities to earn a substantial amount of extra credit. 

Research indicates that students of varying cultural backgrounds may feel more or less comfortable asking for extensions on assignments. Because of this, **I will generally not grant extensions** on assignments. If you are not able to complete an assignment on time, you will need to use one of your drops. If you foresee that you will be unable to complete multiple weeks worth of assignments, then please contact me and we will find a solution.   

## Coding Problems

If you are struggling with a problem on a homework assignment, or wondering about an in-class activity, you have several ways to get help. In approximate order, you should: 

1. Ask a classmate -- for example, one of your project team members. 
2. Post your question on the class discussion forum. 
3. Attend the office hours of either the TA or myself. 

You are permitted to email me questions; however, I may instruct you to post them on the discussion forum. 

## General Academic Concerns

If you have concerns about your grades, general understanding, or ability to keep up in the course, you should initiate a conversation with me. We will set up a separate meeting to make sure you have the resources you need to succeed in this course. 

## Screen Reader Accessibility

It is my sincere goal to ensure that this course is accessible to users of screen readers. It has come to my attention that, the posted lecture notes, it may at times be difficult for screen reader users to distinguish between code input and code output. I have done the following: 

1. Code blocks are preceded by an indicator of the form `In [2]`, standing for "Input Number 2."  
2. When a code block returns a value, the output is preceded by an indicator of the form `Out[2]`, standing for "Output Number 2."
3. When a code block does not return a value, such as when a `print` statement is used, the output is not preceded by an output indicator. Instead, I have added a comment `# ---` between the input code and the printed output. 

Thus, input and output blocks are separated by either an `Out[2]` indicator or a comment `# ---`. 

If you have additional suggestions for how the course can be better made accessible to users of screen readers or other assistive technologies, I will receive them gratefully.
