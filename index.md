PIC16B continues the study of the Python programming language from PIC16A. Python is a modern, interpreted language widely used for software development, scientific computation, and data science. Python is justly famous for its ease of use, extensive set of open-source tools, and vibrant developer community. 

Somewhat informally, the aim of this course is for you to develop into a self-sufficient computational scientist with the Python programming language, so that you can independently perform computational tasks in your studies, hobbies, and careers.  


This offering of PIC16B places special emphasis on project-based learning and technical communication.
