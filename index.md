PIC16B continues the study of the Python programming language from PIC16A. Python is a modern, interpreted language widely used for software development, scientific computation, and data science. Python is justly famous for its ease of use, extensive set of open-source tools, and vibrant online community. 


Somewhat informally, the aim of this course is for you to develop into a self-sufficient computational scientist with the Python programming language, so that you can independently perform computational tasks in your studies, hobbies, and careers.

  <img alt="First panel: one stick figure looks at another stick figure, who is flying. The first figure asks: 'You are flying! How?' The second stick figure replies: 'Python'. Second panel: the second stick figure explains 'I learned it last night! Everything is so simple! Hello world is just print Hello World!'. Third panel: The first figure responds: 'I dunno...dynamic typing? Whitespace?' The second figure enthuses: 'Come join us! Programming is fun again! It is a whole new world up here!' The first figure asks: 'But how are you flying?' Final panel: The second figure answers: `I just typed import antigravity. First figure: 'That's it?' Second figure: '...I also sampled everything in the medicine cabinet for comparison. But I think this is the Python.' " src = "https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python.png" width="400"/>
