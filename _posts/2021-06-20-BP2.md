This blog post follows a somewhat more definite sequence than others. For this reason, I thought you might find it convenient to have a pre-constructed Jupyter Notebook for you to fill in. Find it [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/blob/master/HW/spectral-clustering.ipynb). Please note that, although I've supplied explanations for various steps, part of the blog post spec is for you to write your own explanations in your own words. Extreme mathematical detail is not necessary, but you are expected to make an effort to communicate to your reader the meaning of the various computations. Submissions that include language taken verbatim from the linked notebook will be assessed as <span style="color: gold;"><i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-up"></i></span> **In Progress**.
